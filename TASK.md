Build a Conversational BI Platform (Node.js/ TypeScript or GO)
Overview
Build a text-to-SQL platform that lets users connect their PostgreSQL database, ask natural language questions, and get answers with auto-generated visualizations. Include a pre-seeded demo database so users can try it instantly.
Core Requirements
Pre-seeded Demo Database: Use Faker.js to generate realistic ecommerce data (customers, products, orders, order_items, categories, reviews)- 10K+ orders spanning 12 months. Host this as a read-only demo database users can query immediately.
Custom Database Connection: Allow users to connect their own PostgreSQL database by providing connection string (host, port, database, user, password). Support both the demo DB and user DBs.
One-Click Schema Analysis: On connect, automatically introspect the database schema. Extract tables, columns, data types, foreign key relationships, and sample values. Present a clear, readable schema summary to the user.
Natural Language Queries: Users type questions in plain English (e.g., "Show me top 10 customers by total spend last quarter"). Generate SQL, execute it safely, and return results. Handle follow-up questions with context (e.g., "Now show only from California").
Auto-Generated Visualizations: Detect the result type and render appropriate charts (bar, line, pie, scatter, tables). Users should be able to switch chart types manually.
Ad-Hoc Dashboards: Let users save query results as dashboard widgets. Build and arrange multiple widgets into a dashboard view. Dashboards should be shareable via link.
Query Safety: Implement safeguards- limit result rows, prevent destructive queries (DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE), timeout long-running queries.
Basic Authentication: Fixed username/password for demo access. Store user API keys securely for LLM calls.
LLM Requirements
Use a frontier model (GPT, Claude Opus/Sonnet, or Gemini) for schema analysis and SQL generation
User provides their own API key (stored in session or local storage- no backend key storage required)
Model must receive full schema context + sample data to generate accurate SQL
Implement retry and fallback for model errors
Example Queries Your Platform Should Handle
"What were the top 5 products by revenue last month?" → bar chart with product names and revenue
"Show me order count by day for the past 30 days" → line chart with date on X-axis
"Which customers have placed more than 10 orders but never left a review?" → table with customer details
"Compare revenue by category this quarter vs last quarter" → grouped bar chart or comparison table
"What is the average order value by customer segment?" → pie chart or table with segments
Constraints
No text-to-SQL platforms or SaaS wrappers (e.g., no Vanna AI, no Text-to-SQL managed services)
No BI frameworks that abstract the SQL generation (e.g., no Metabase embedding, no Superset)
You may use: PostgreSQL client libraries (pg, node-postgres), chart libraries (Chart.js, Recharts, ECharts), LLM provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
The SQL generation logic, schema analysis, and chart recommendation must be implemented from scratch using raw LLM calls
PostgreSQL only- no MySQL, SQLite, or other databases required
Technical Stack (Suggested)
Backend: Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes (or Go)
Frontend: React, Vue, or vanilla JS
Database: PostgreSQL (host demo on Supabase, Neon, Railway, or similar free tier)
Charts: Chart.js, Recharts, ECharts, or similar
LLM: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, or Google AI API
Grading Criteria
UI/UX quality — is the interface intuitive? Does it feel polished?
Code structure, readability, and maintainability
Accuracy of SQL generation across diverse query types
Quality of schema analysis and presentation
Chart selection and rendering quality
Error handling and edge case coverage
Speed and responsiveness.
Submission
GitHub repo with clear README and setup instructions
Video demo (2-3 min walkthrough demoing the work)
Deployed web app (can use Vercel)
Demo database must be accessible and pre-seeded
Note
While you are free to use coding agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor etc.) as assistants- refrain from completely vibe coding (we can easily tell and will lead to direct rejection), Take the time to refine the AI generated code to be production ready. The goal is to evaluate how quickly you can ship a working, production-quality system. There is no fixed deadline, but your time-to-completion will be benchmarked against other candidates.
Do not use the name "Libra" for your application.
